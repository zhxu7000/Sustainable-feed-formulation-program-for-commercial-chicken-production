# Project Wiki

This is the Bitbucket Wiki for the project **P14 â€“ Sustainable Feed Formulation Program for Commercial Chicken Production**.

## Client
USYD, Faculty of Science, SOLES

## Project Aim
Delivery of a mutually accessible web page allowing least-cost feed formulation to optimise feed cost without compromising nutrient requirements for animals.

## Project Scope
Least cost feed formulation program is used for poultry nutritionist to formulate diet to satisfy nutrient requirements of chickens at different production stage. This includes linear optimisation between feed ingredient cost, nutrient content and animal nutrient requirements. different optimizers can be selected to, for example, distance of transportation for less emission or best growth performance but not the least feed cost.

## Project Objectives (SMART)
- **Specific**: Our goal is to establish a comprehensive and educational website dedicated to deliver accurate and up-to-date information about various types of chicken feed to poultry producers. Feed cost is 70-85% of total production cost and the composition of diet changes with raw material availability and cost. The page will contain database of feed ingredients, including their cost and nutrient compositions; nutrient requirements for birds at different growing and reproductive phases in order to formulate diet for optimal bird production, health and welfare.

- **Measurable**: We will monitor the website's traffic and engagement data to determine the accomplishment of this goal. Within the first six months of the website's introduction, we hope to have at least 100 unique visitors per month. Web analytics technologies will be used to track the amount of visitors, pageviews, time spent on the site, and interactions with the content.

- **Attainable**: We will work with Dr. Liu to gather accurate information on the type of feed, nutritional requirements and feeding guidelines for chickens. We will provide assistance with website construction, content generation, UI beautifying, multiple concurrent access, and security to ensure that this website can continue to support Dr. Liu's teaching efforts in the future.

- **Relevant**: This goal is consistent with our mission of assisting poultry producers to feed chickens based on a range of raw materials with various nutrient profiles, cost and availability. such practice will encourage usage of local feed ingredients, reduce feed cost while maintaining bird performance. This also facilitates sustainable poultry production by providing the liberty for nutritionists to include new ingredients and nutrients based on scientific findings in poultry nutrition. 

- **Time-Bound**: Within the next three months, we will develop a fully functional chicken feed formulation with high-quality database, interactive tools, and user-friendly navigation.

## Success Criteria
Develop an interactive feed formula full-stack website with a clear user interface and operation guide. Achieving the lowest cost formulations for different stages of production of chickens, based on feed ingredient cost, nutrient content, and animal requirements, provides a useful tool for animal science undergraduate teaching.
